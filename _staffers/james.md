bio: Hi y'all! I'm a senior from Virginia studying computer science and data science. When I'm not in the classroom, you can usually find me in the Student Union working for the ASUC or at one of a couple of coffee shops around campus. I'm super excited to be teaching Data 6, and hope you enjoy learning data science as much as I do.
