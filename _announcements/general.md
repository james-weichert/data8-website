Welcome to the final week of Data 6 &#x1F972; As we finish out the semester, please take note of the following important announcements:

* **Homework 5** and **Survey 5** have been released and will be due on ***Wednesday*** **(8/10) at 11 PM**
    * The Homework 5 deadline is on Wednesday instead of Thursday this week to give you time to study for the final exam on Friday. We have made Homework 5 shorter to account for the earlier deadline.
    * Remember that we will drop your lowest homework grade. See our [grading policies](https://data6.org/su22/syllabus/#homework-drops-and-extra-credit) for more details.
* The **Final Exam** will take place this **Friday, August 12th at 10AM** in Evans 10
    * Taking the final exam is required to pass the class.
    * If you require accommodations for the exam such as extended time, please reach out to [James](https://data6.org/su22/staff/) and [Will](https://data6.org/su22/staff/) via email ASAP.
